# CourseParser.jl
 Parsing scripts for optimisation courses. Convert complete jupyter notebooks into skeletons. Utilises .jl scripts as intermediate files.
 
 Consider that complete notebooks have all the answers. Code lines that are to be hidden in the skeleton start with `#%`. Those are removed when generating the skeleton.
